        <p>
          I worked at NimbusDev as a Full Stack Developer, contributing to the
          development of a Hub and ERP system used to centralize and manage
          business operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was responsible for building and maintaining important system
          interfaces, focusing on performance, usability, and scalability.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the front end, I developed dynamic data tables using AgGrid and
          custom-built components. On the back end, I handled the full data
          flow, from database queries and API development to delivering
          structured data to the user interface.
